    <h2>Computer Technology</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Computer technology is leading to more accurate sizing and rating methods for process equipment. Heat exchangers are designed with high-precision prediction methods and complex numerical techniques to account for the local flow and temperature conditions. Fouling mitigation is just changing from an art to a science-based technology. The real benefits of sophisticated design codes will not be achieved without reliable fouling prediction methods and mitigation techniques that can be incorporated into the design phase. Recent developments in the computer technology provide an opportunity to productively use fouling information that is scattered in the literature, industry log books, and in reports. A long-term goal for the industry is to develop a knowledge-based system for designing and operating heat exchangers with a minimum impact of water fouling. </p>
